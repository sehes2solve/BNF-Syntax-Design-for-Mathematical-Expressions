// for associativity rules as it wasn't defined in assesment's description 
// i have used the two operator properties tables in lecture 2 page 6  associativity rules
// however if that wasn't what intended to do for assesment the basic idea is simple :
// right associative operators described using right recursive rules & left associative
// operators described using left recursive rules this will do the trick
